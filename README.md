# Juniper Automation Bootcamp
Public Repository for the SDN Essentials Juniper Automation Bootcamp Content

This repository contains all the necessary scripts for the Juniper Automation Bootcamp. It uses Vagrant to automate the provisioning of the Ansible workstation called ndo on this lab, two vSRXs and two private linux vms. There are multiple steps to this lab where you will be creating and applying scripts to the different devices deployed.



i.      What does the repo contain?
ii.      What does the VagrantFile build (topology diagram would be nice)?
iii.      How do I make this work?
iv.      Who to contact if you need help?
